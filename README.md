# Jones-HTML-and-CSS-course-Practice-Project-s

Welcome to my HTML and CSS practice repository! Here, I'm applying Jonas Schmedtmann's "Building a Real World and Responsive Website using HTML and CSS" course concepts to refine my skills.

Inside:

1. Jonas' provided starter files for course projects.
2. Practice files for experimenting with HTML/CSS techniques.
3. Updated files reflecting my progress.
4. GitHub usage helps me understand version control and collaboration while building my portfolio.

Feel free to explore
